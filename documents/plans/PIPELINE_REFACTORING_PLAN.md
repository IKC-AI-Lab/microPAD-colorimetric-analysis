# Pipeline Refactoring Implementation Plan

**Project:** microPAD Colorimetric Analysis Pipeline
**Goal:** Refactor 5-stage to 4-stage pipeline by combining crop_micropad_papers.m and cut_concentration_rectangles.m
**Created:** 2025-10-30
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-30

## Overview

Combine `crop_micropad_papers.m` and `cut_concentration_rectangles.m` into new `cut_micropads.m` script to streamline the pipeline from 5 stages to 4 stages.

**Current Pipeline:**
```
1_dataset → 2_micropad_papers → 3_concentration_rectangles → 4_elliptical_regions → 5_extract_features
```

**New Pipeline:**
```
1_dataset → 2_micropads → 3_elliptical_regions → 4_extract_features
```

## Design Decisions (User-Confirmed)

1. **Rotation column placement:** Last column (10th field) in coordinates.txt
   - Format: `image concentration x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3 x4 y4 rotation`
2. **AI detection behavior:** Always auto re-run after rotation changes
3. **Migration strategy:** All-at-once after validation on samples
4. **Augmentation logic:** Simplify to direct polygon transforms (remove back-projection)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All dependent MATLAB scripts updated and tested
- [ ] Ground truth data migrated successfully
- [ ] Python scripts updated and compatible

- [x] Added pipeline overview section with stage flow diagrams
- [x] Documented coordinate formats:
  - YOLO format: 9 values (normalized, for training)
  - MATLAB format: 10 values (pixel coords with rotation)
- [x] Updated integration section (PyTorch for MATLAB, TFLite for Android)
- [x] Clarified that Python training scripts need no changes

**Validation:** Python scripts process augmented data without errors (scripts already compatible)

- [x] `.claude/agents/code-orchestrator.md`: Review completed (deferred - low priority)
- [x] Other agent files (ieee-latex-writer, git-commit-manager, plan-writer): Deferred
  - Note: These contain old folder paths but don't affect pipeline functionality
  - Can be updated incrementally as agents are used

### Phase 5.3: Plan Documentation

## Phase 6: End-to-End Validation

**Goal:** Verify entire pipeline works correctly

### Phase 6.1: Test Full Pipeline on Samples
- [ ] Select 10 representative samples (multiple phones, concentrations)
- [ ] Run complete pipeline:
   1. `cut_micropads.m` (with rotation + AI detection)
   2. `cut_elliptical_regions.m`
   3. `extract_features.m`
- [ ] Verify outputs at each stage
- [ ] Compare features with old pipeline outputs (should be similar)

### Phase 6.2: Test Augmentation Pipeline
- [ ] Run `augment_dataset.m` with simplified transform logic
- [ ] Verify synthetic data generated correctly
- [ ] Check corner labels exported correctly (if enabled)
- [ ] Verify Python scripts can consume augmented data

### Phase 6.3: Performance Validation
- [ ] Measure processing time for new pipeline
- [ ] Compare with old pipeline (should be similar or faster)
- [ ] Verify memory usage acceptable
- [ ] Check for any performance regressions

### Phase 6.4: Final Integration Test
- [ ] Process entire dataset end-to-end
- [ ] Generate feature tables for all chemicals
- [ ] Verify feature table formats match expectations
- [ ] Confirm no breaking changes for downstream ML models

**Validation:** Complete pipeline processes all data successfully

### Phase 6.5: Pre-Validation Folder Rename (NOT NEEDED)
**Status:** ✅ No action required

**Analysis:** The augmented stage 2 and 3 folders do not exist yet in the filesystem:
- `augmented_2_concentration_rectangles/` - does not exist
- `augmented_3_elliptical_regions/` - does not exist

**Conclusion:** These folders will be created with correct names when `augment_dataset.m` is run in the future:
- `augmented_2_micropads/` (correct name already in updated code)
- `augmented_3_elliptical_regions/` (correct name already in updated code)

**No pre-validation folder rename needed**

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues discovered during validation:

1. **Restore old pipeline:**
   - Rename `_old` folders back to original names
   - Restore from backup if needed

2. **Revert code changes:**
   - Use git to revert commits related to refactoring
   - Document issues encountered

3. **Create bug report:**
   - Document specific failures
   - Gather error logs and problematic samples
   - Re-plan refactoring approach

- Keep old data backed up until full validation complete
- AI detection uses YOLOv11 via detectQuadsYOLO function
- Rotation is cumulative (memory + user input = total rotation)
